Yoooooooooo Auditor

How You doin?

This project is simple. recieve a file with statistical data and
return some statistical analysis. This time, the language used is
java (needed to get ready for uni lol) so have fun!

Also shoutout to yaman for being the most goated java teacher (seriously I got into
coding primarily due to how passionate he was).

sincerely,
Abdulrahman Khaled (akhaled)
